# FlashNotes

## Description

FlashNotes is a block-based note-taking app (similar to Notion). The app combines photos, flashcards, and text into a singular file allowing users to study content and flashcards next to each other. The app also offers users the ability to practice their flashcards using spelling and standard flashcard practice modes.
